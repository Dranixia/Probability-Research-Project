## Aim

At this research we process the data of weather of certain town and try to build a model that determines which features 
Humidity depends on. Additionally, we try to approximately determine the distribution of the Humidity.

## Dataset and Features

Dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/datasets-for-regression-analysis

Among all features, we have chosen only those that correlated with humidity, however, after analyzing the data,
 we had to get rid of certain data, as it wasn't numerical and there was no proper way to use it. Despite that, we have some features left 
 that could correlate with chosen parameter.
